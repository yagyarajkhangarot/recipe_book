    <h3> “Description”</h3>
    <p>What is in dal?
        Image result for description of dal
        Derived from the Sanskrit word that means “to split”, dal is a collective term for pulses—lentils, peas, and beans. While sometimes used in other dishes, these pulses are usually served slow-simmered into a soft, porridge-like dish that's also called dal.</p>

            <li>Soak both ¾ cup whole urad dal (whole black gram) and ¼ cup rajma (kidney beans) overnight in enough water for 8 to 9 hours.</li>
            <li> Drain them well. The below photo shows the soaked whole urad dal and rajma.Rinse the urad lentils and rajma legumes a couple of times in water.</li>
            <li>Drain well and then add them in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles on a high flame, till both the whole urad dal and rajma have cooked thoroughly and softened. </li>
            <li>  You can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to check the doneness. The same rule applies for kidney beans too.</li>
