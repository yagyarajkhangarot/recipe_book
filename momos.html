        Image result for description of sooji halwa
        'Halwa' comes from the Arabic word 'hulw', which means sweet. A dish that came in from Turkey is now served as kada prasad in Gurdwaras, is associated with the Hindu festival of Navratri, and even plays an important role in the Union budget</p>
        <h3>“Ingredients”</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sooji</li>
            <li>Ghee</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Dry fruits</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>"Steps"</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>>For this recipe, I do use same amount (1/2 cup) of ghee and sooji. I slightly cut down on the sugar and use 1/3 cup.</li>
            <li>You can very well 1/2 cup so then it will be 1/2 cup of each ingredient.</li>
            <li>I use 3 times the water since I like my halwa more on the softer side. And I don’t do 100% water but rather 50% milk and 50% water for a creamier halwa.</li>
            <li>Roast the sooji until fragrant: the most important step! If you don’t roast the sooji properly, the halwa will have raw taste.I don’t like to brown my sooji for the halwa. So I roast it on low heat, stirring continuously until it’s nice and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Be careful while adding the liquid: when you add hot liquid (water and milk in this case) to the hot pan of roasted sooji, it bubbles up like crazy. So be very careful!</li>
            <li>Stir constantly to avoid forming lumps: to make sure your halwa is smooth, stir continuously as you add the liquids.</li>
            <li> If you don’t do that, it will form lumps and won’t have the creamy texture</li>
        </ol>
